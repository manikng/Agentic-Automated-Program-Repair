# 🔧 Automated Code Correction Using LLM-Powered Agents

*A QuixBugs Benchmark Study*

**Author:** Manish Singh 
**Project:** Automated Code Correction Agent Development

---

## 📌 Executive Summary

This project presents the development and evaluation of an **LLM-powered agent** for automated detection and correction of **single-line defects** in Python programs using the **QuixBugs benchmark**.

* **Achieved Accuracy:** ✅ 86% (43/50 programs successfully corrected)
* **Benchmark:** QuixBugs (University of Washington)
* **Defect Classes:** 14 categories analyzed & targeted repair strategies implemented
* **Performance:** Competitive with existing **Automated Program Repair (APR)** techniques
* **Future Goal:** Integration with **MMAPR framework** for achieving **93–96% accuracy**

## 📜 Problem Motivation

* **Economic Impact:** Software bugs cost ~$2.84 trillion annually
* **Time Drain:** Debugging consumes 50–75% of dev time
* **Limitations of Tools:** No existing solution addresses both syntactic & semantic bugs simultaneously
* **Case Example:** Windows *Blue Screen of Death* caused by a **single-line pointer error**

---

## ⚡ Challenges Addressed

* Context preservation while fixing defects
* Avoiding false positives and overcorrections
* Handling semantic vs syntactic bugs
* Ensuring test coverage for **all edge cases**
* Overcoming **API rate limits** and **model simplicity trade-offs**

## 🧠 Approach

### 🔹 Defect Analysis & Categorization

We identified **14 defect classes** in QuixBugs:

| Defect Class            | Frequency | Example                                 | Repair Strategy           |
| ----------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Off-by-one error        | 28%       | `range(len(arr)-1)` → `range(len(arr))` | Boundary adjustment       |
| Incorrect operators     | 22%       | `< → <=`, `== → is`                     | Operator replacement      |
| Missing null checks     | 15%       | `if x is not None:`                     | Defensive programming     |
| Logical conditionals    | 12%       | `and → or`                              | Logic operator correction |
| Variable initialization | 8%        | Wrong defaults                          | Scope-aware init          |
| Other                   | 15%       | Mixed patterns                          | Case-specific fixes       |

---

### 🔹 Agent Architecture

```python
agent_executor = create_react_agent(model, tools)

tools = [
    run_python_code,           # Code execution & validation
    run_python_code_from_file, # File-based testing
    iterative_fix_and_test     # Multi-attempt repair workflow
]
```

🛠 **Workflow**

1. Detect defect (pattern classification)
2. Generate repair suggestion
3. Run automated tests with `pytest`
4. Iterate with error feedback (max 5 attempts)
5. Save fixed program

📍 *![](pics/model_workflow.png)*

---

## ✅ Results

### 📊 Performance Summary

* **Total Programs:** 50
* **Corrected:** 43 (86%)
* **Failed Repairs:** 7
* **Avg Attempts per Fix:** 1.8
* **Fix Time:** ⏱️ 5–10s (vs human 15–30 min)

### 🧪 Success Rate by Defect Class

* Off-by-one errors → **92%**
* Comparison operators → **95%**
* Null checks → **78%**
* Logical conditionals → **83%**
* Variable initialization → **100%**


---

### 🔎 Failure Analysis (7 Programs)

* Complex multi-line logic dependencies
* Ambiguous defect classification
* Rare edge cases not in training data
* Example: **shortest_path_lengths.py** failed due to state initialization missing

## 📈 Comparative Benchmark

| Method        | QuixBugs Accuracy | Key Limitation              |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Our Agent** | **86%**           | Complex dependencies        |
| GenProg       | 65%               | Weak semantic understanding |
| Prophet       | 58%               | Pattern overfitting         |
| CodeT5        | 72%               | Single-attempt limitation   |
| Human Expert  | 100%              | Time-intensive              |

## 🔮 Future Work

### 1️⃣ MMAPR Framework Integration

* Multi-modal input (ASTs, error traces, natural language)
* Few-shot learning with peer programs
* Ensemble repair with **multiple LLM backends** (GPT-4, Gemini, CodeT5)

📍 *Inspired and implemented based on 
![alt text](image-1.png)*

### 2️⃣ Technical Enhancements

* Multi-language support (Python → Java, C++, JS)
* Static & dynamic analysis integration (SonarQube, CodeQL)
* CI/CD pipeline & IDE plugin integration
